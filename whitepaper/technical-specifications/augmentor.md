# Augmentor

## Motivation

Looking up and consuming information sources forms a daily task for an employee. It can be from various sources, but the internet is the source involved in the majority of the cases.&#x20;

As such, keeping in line with our principle of "Human-centric AI", we have created the Augmentor that augments information for you from the internet, depending on the source you point it to.

## About

The Augmentor is a platform-wide component that takes in a particular website, and your query that instructs it about the information to look for and the way to structure it. It forms an integral part of our Alchemyst experience. Transform chaos into clarity with Augmentor - scrape unstructured data and mold it into the precise format you need, effortlessly.

## The road ahead

Our moonshot is to implement a fully functional augmentation component into the User Experience such that you just type in the type of information you need, and Augmentor can look up different sources  (the public internet, your internal company knowledge base, etc) and augment missing information such that it takes the context in consideration.
