## About Us

### The mission

> **We’re Not Building AI Bots. We’re Not Building AI Agents. We’re Building Alchemysts.**

There are 100s of companies creating faceless AI agents/tools to automate specific tasks – we're building it differently. Alchemysts act as additional team members, taking over where they’re able to and calling in human help when needed. We envision a world in which humans & Alchemysts work alongside one another to propel humanity forward and drive economic growth that benefits everybody.

### The vision

Alchemyst AI envisions to build an entire ecosystem of gen-AI digital employees which can interact with each other and form highly intelligent and cohesive functional components in B2B early stage to mid-sized enterprises.\
\
We aim to build Alchemysts as force multipliers within teams across various industries. Starting with Maya, our first Alchemyst for Sales Development. We would soon be horizontally scaling to other roles as well.

### What are Alchemysts?

Alchemysts can be thought of as virtual AI-based personas that can execute workflows throughout the day, across the company’s different verticals, supplementing your workforce and enabling teams to be 50x more productive. So in cases where you have understaffed teams, Alchemysts can bolster the teams upto the necessary level of bandwidth required.&#x20;

With multilingual and multimodal capabilities, they are not just another additional tool for your team, but way more than that - think of intelligent interns/junior employees who can bear the brunt of laborious work, while your teams can free up bandwidth for more creativity-oriented tasks.
