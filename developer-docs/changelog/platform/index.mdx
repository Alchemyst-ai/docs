title: Platform 
description: A chronological breakdown of product, platform, and infrastructure changes across the context and memory platform.
---

## December 2025

### Early–Mid December 2025
**Ingestion Performance & Reliability**

- Introduced **magic keys** to reference and share context with teammates without duplicating or re-ingesting data
- Added **async ingestion routes** backed by a job queue
- Enabled **non-blocking uploads**, improving throughput and system stability under load

---

### Mid–Late December 2025
**Context Visualization & Platform Experience**

- Rolled out a **full UI and platform revamp**, including the Playground, to streamline experimentation and iteration workflows
- Playground evolved beyond conversation into a full-fledged **experimentation environment**:
  - Upload data directly
  - Work with shared memory via **magic keys**
  - Iterate on context without leaving the Playground

---

## November 2025

### Mid–Late November 2025
**Context Visualization**

- Revamped **context-graph visualization** with dual views:
  - **Document view** to explore context grouped by source documents
  - **Node view** to inspect individual context nodes and relationships
- Added **group-name based clustering** to logically organize related documents and nodes
- Enabled **direct graph interactions**:
  - Edit context nodes in place
  - Delete nodes directly from the graph
  - Instantly reflect changes across connected context

---

### Early–Mid November 2025
**Namespaces**

- Introduced **Namespaces** to group and scope data under logical boundaries
- Enabled cleaner data organization and more precise context retrieval
- Improved support for **multi-tenant** and **multi-project** workflows

---

## October 2025

### Mid–Late October 2025
**Context Retrieval**

- Improved context processor powering faster, more efficient retrieval
- Reduced retrieval latency by **~71%** (from ~7s to ~2s)
- Improved fast-mode retrieval latency by **~57%** (from ~400ms to ~170ms)

---

### Early–Mid October 2025
**SDK Release**

- Released **TypeScript** and **Python SDKs** for seamless integration with any AI agent or application
- Simplified context ingestion, retrieval, and memory management through a unified, developer-friendly API
- Designed for quick drop-in adoption across agent frameworks, services, and custom pipelines

---

## Summary

Across 2025, the platform evolved from foundational data infrastructure into a faster, more observable, and developer-friendly **context and memory layer**, delivering major gains in ingestion speed, retrieval latency, automation, and usability.
