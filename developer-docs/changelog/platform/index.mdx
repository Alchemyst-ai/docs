description: A chronological breakdown of product, platform, and infrastructure changes across the context and memory platform.
---

## December 2025

### Context Visualization & Platform Experience
**Date:** Mid-Late December 2025

 
- Rolled out a **full UI and platform revamp**, including the playground, to streamline experimentation and iteration workflows 
- Playground evolved beyond conversation - a full-fledged **environment to experiment** with context, upload data directly, and work with shared memory using magic keys.
---

### Ingestion Performance & Reliability
**Date:** Early-Mid December 2025

- Introduced magic keys to reference and share context with friends or team without duplicating or re-ingesting data.
- Added **async ingestion routes** backed by a job queue  
- Enabled **non-blocking uploads**, improving throughput and system stability under load

## November 2025

### Context Visualization
**Date:** Mid-Late November 2025
- Revamped **context-graph visualization** with dual views:
  - **Document view** to explore context grouped by source documents
  - **Node view** to inspect individual context nodes and their relationships
- Added **group-name based clustering**, enabling logical grouping of related documents and nodes within the graph
- **direct graph interactions** made accessible:
  - Edit context nodes in-place
  - Delete nodes directly from the graph
  - Instantly reflect changes across connected context

---

### Namespaces
**Date:** Early-Mid November 2025
- Introduced **Namespaces** to group and scope data under logical boundaries
- Enabled cleaner data organization and more precise context retrieval  
- Improved support for multi-tenant and multi-project workflows 

---

## October 2025

### Context retrieval
**Date:** Mid-Late October 2025
- Faster, more efficient context processing powering low-latency retrieval
- Reduced retrieval latency by **~71%** (from ~7s to ~2s)  
- Improved fast-mode retrieval latency by **~57%** (from ~400ms to ~170ms)

---

### SDK Rlease
**Date:** Early-Mid October 2025
- Released **TypeScript** and **Python SDKs** for seamless integration with any AI agent or application  
- Simplified context ingestion, retrieval, and memory management through a unified, developer-friendly API  
- Designed for quick drop-in adoption across agent frameworks, services, and custom pipelines


---

## Summary

Across 2025, the platform evolved from foundational data infrastructure to a faster, more observable, and developer-friendly **context and memory layer**, with major gains in ingestion speed, retrieval latency, automation, and usability.
