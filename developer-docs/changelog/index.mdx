Past few months (oct - dec, 2025), we focused on strengthening the **context layer**, improving performance and developer experience across the platform.

### The milestones we reached 
- **ingestion speed and reliability**
  - Introduced add-async routes adding a job queue for faster upload without blocking.
- **UI revamp**
  - Simplified navigation and workflows to make core features easier and faster to use.
- **Retrival speed**
  - Reduced  retrieval time by **~71%** (from ~7s to ~2s)
  - Improved fast mode latency by **~57%** (from ~400ms to ~170ms) 
- **Introduced Namespaces**
  - Group and scope data under named namespaces for precise, controlled context retrieval.
