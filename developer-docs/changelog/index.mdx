description: Key platform, performance, and developer experience updates.

Past couple of months (Oct - Dec, 2025), we focused on strengthening the **context layer**, improving performance and developer experience across the platform.

### The milestones we reached
- **Ingestion Speed and reliability**
  - We toiled at improving our ingestion speed as much as possible, and will continue doing so. We improved our upload times by around 37% for large documents, and by >70% over short conversations. Exact numbers may vary, and so do the speedups; but they are definitely there!
- **UI Revamp**
  - We simplified navigation and workflows to make core features easier and faster to use. Onboarding experience is shorter and smoother, whether you're a user trying to make ChatGPT remember stuff, or an experienced developer incorporating context to your AI agent!
- **Retrieval speed**
  - Reduced **ranked** retrieval time (radius: 10k data points) by **~71%** (from ~4s to ~1.14s)
  - Improved latency for `fast` mode by **~57%** (from p50 ~400ms to p50 ~170ms)
- **Introduced Namespaces**
  - Group and scope data under named namespaces for precise, controlled context retrieval.
