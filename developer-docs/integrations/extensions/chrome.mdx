description: Use Alchemyst AI’s memory inside AI models through our Chrome extension.

## Installation and setup

To install and configure the Chrome extension, follow the step-by-step guide:

**[Chrome Extension Tutorial](/tutorials/chrome-extension)**

The tutorial covers:
- Installing the extension
- Connecting it to your Alchemyst workspace
- Capturing memory and context
- Using memory inside supported AI models


## Why memory at all?

LLMs are stateless by design — every time you press **Send**, the model starts from a blank slate. When it lacks past interactions, domain facts, or user preferences, it can only guess at the bigger picture, producing answers that feel generic or even contradictory from turn to turn. Persistent **memory** solves this problem by:

* **Preserving short-term continuity**  - a rolling buffer of the current conversation keeps the model from re-asking questions it already “heard.”
* **Holding long-term knowledge**  - facts, policies, and prior decisions stay available across sessions, turning a reactive chatbot into a proactive collaborator.
* **Personalising responses**  - episodic, semantic, and procedural memories let the AI adapt to individual users and multi-step workflows instead of delivering one-size-fits-all output.

Without this layered memory architecture, even the smartest model repeats itself, forgets goals, and forces you to copy-paste context manually. With it, AI can reason over time, reference earlier work, and finish complex tasks without starting from zero.

## How the Chrome extension works

The extension acts as a lightweight memory layer between you and the model:

1. You capture context or memory directly from the browser  
2. Alchemyst stores and indexes it securely  
3. Relevant memory is automatically injected when you interact with an AI model  
4. The model responds with awareness of past information and intent  


## When to use the Chrome extension

The Chrome extension is ideal when you:
- Work directly in browser-based LLMs
- Want memory without building custom integrations
- Need consistent context across tools and sessions
- Prefer a no-code way to use Alchemyst

If you later need deeper control or automation, you can move seamlessly to the SDKs and APIs.

## Use Cases :

As you are all set to use the extension let’s now look and some of the cool stuff you can do with it.

### **For Everyone :**

#### **1. AI Models that actually remembers you**

Tired of AI models forgetting who you are every time you open a new chat? With Alchemyst AI memory, you can make it remember your preferences, goals, or habits. Whether it’s your fitness routine, favorite food, or daily schedule, AI Model will keep it in mind and talk like it actually knows you.

#### **2. Continuous learning buddy**

If you are learning a new skill, language, or preparing for exams, you don’t need to start from scratch every session. AI Model will remember your progress, weak areas, and even your previous questions so it can build on them next time you open it.

#### **3. Personal journal and reflection space**

Want to track your thoughts or daily reflections? You can use memory to keep your past entries. AI Model can summarize your week, analyze your writing tone, or give you insights on how your mindset has changed over time.

#### **4. Smarter recommendations**

Every suggestion becomes better with memory. From movies, recipes, or books, AI Model will personalize recommendations based on what you’ve liked before, without you needing to remind it every time.

### **For Developers :**

#### **1. Your AI coding partner with context**

Developers can finally stop re-explaining their stack, framework, and project setup in every session. Once AI Model remembers your project details, it can help you faster and more accurately the next time you ask for help.

#### **2. Smarter debugging sessions**

No more “start from zero” debugging. AI Model will recall your previous error logs from alchemyst’s memory, the fixes you tried, and what worked or didn’t, so you can pick up where you left off seamlessly.

#### **3. Technical writing made easier**

If you often write documentation, commit messages, or changelogs, adding a single reference doc on the platform can help gpt remember your team’s writing style and project tone. It can help you generate consistent documentation without having to guide it repeatedly.

#### **4. Shared team memory**

Teams can share one memory setup for a project so every member gets the same context inside AI Model. Perfect for consistent onboarding, documentation, and communication across dev teams.

With Alchemyst AI’s Chrome extension, AI models becomes more than just a chatbot. It becomes your personal assistant, teacher, or coding partner that actually remembers what matters to you.
