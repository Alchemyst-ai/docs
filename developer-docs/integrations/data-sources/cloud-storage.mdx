## Introduction

Cloud storage integrations allow you to ingest files, documents, and media from object storage systems directly into your Alchemyst context layer. Sync entire buckets and keep your agent's knowledge synchronized with your storage instead of manual uploads or one-time imports.

## Why Connect Cloud Storage?

Traditional file-based workflows break down because files are scattered across services, manual operations are error-prone, large files exceed context windows, and there's no way to query across files semantically.

With Alchemyst's [cloud storage integrations](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=getalchemystai.com&utm_campaign=docs&utm_medium=web):

- Sync fresh data whenever context is needed
- Search semantically across documents, images, and logs
- Support multimodal content (PDFs, images, CSVs, JSON, and more)
- Share the same context with the whole team

Your agent sees files as meaning, not just bytes.

## Amazon S3

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is the industry-standard object storage platform, commonly used for document archives, media libraries, data lakes, and backups.

### How to Connect

**Prerequisites:**
- AWS account with S3 access
- S3 bucket with files to sync
- IAM credentials with read permissions

**What You Need:**
- Bucket Name (S3 bucket identifier)
- AWS Access Key ID (IAM user access key)
- AWS Secret Access Key (IAM user secret key)
- Region (AWS region, e.g., `us-east-1`)
- Prefix/Folder (optional path filter)

Alchemyst can index text files, documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX), images with OCR, structured data (Parquet, JSONL, XML), and code repositories.

### IAM Permissions

Create a dedicated IAM user with read-only S3 access. Grant only `s3:GetObject` and `s3:ListBucket` permissions to the specific buckets you want to sync.

---

## Supported File Types

**Documents:** PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, MD  
**Data:** CSV, JSON, JSONL, XML, Parquet, YAML  
**Images:** PNG, JPG, SVG (with OCR and vision models)  
**Code:** All text-based source files

---

## Security Best Practices

For cloud storage integrations:

- Use IAM roles instead of access keys when possible
- Grant only read-only permissions
- Enable bucket encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
- Restrict public access to sensitive buckets
- Use HTTPS-only access policies
- Enable S3 access logging to monitor activity
- Rotate credentials regularly

---

## Performance & Cost Optimization

**Sync Strategies:**
- Full Sync: For small buckets with static content
- Incremental Sync: For large buckets with frequent updates
- Event-Driven: For real-time updates using S3 event notifications

**Cost Reduction:**
- Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for infrequent access
- Set lifecycle policies to archive old files
- Limit sync frequency for static content
- Use prefix filters to avoid listing entire buckets
- Filter by file type to exclude unnecessary files

---

## Next Steps

Once S3 is connected, you can search across your files semantically, combine cloud storage with databases and other sources, and enable real-time sync with webhooks.
