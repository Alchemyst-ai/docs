description: "Connect MongoDB databases to your Alchemyst context layer"

## Overview

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database, ideal for:

- User profiles and account data
- Content management systems
- Event logs and analytics
- Flexible schema applications

## Why Connect MongoDB?

Traditional AI agents struggle with operational data because:

- **Data changes constantly** - Static exports become outdated quickly
- **Manual exports go stale** - Syncing requires constant maintenance  
- **Querying requires technical knowledge** - Non-technical users can't access data easily

With Alchemyst MongoDB integration, you can:

- ✓ Sync fresh data whenever context is needed
- ✓ Search semantically across collections and documents
- ✓ Combine database results with other data sources
- ✓ Query in natural language without writing aggregation pipelines

Your databases become queryable context that responds to meaning, not just raw data.

## Getting Started

![Database Integration Setup](../../../images/integrations1.jpeg)

To connect MongoDB to Alchemyst:

1. Navigate to the [Alchemyst Integrations page](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=mongodb_docs&utm_medium=web)
2. Click **Add Integration** → **MongoDB**
3. Provide your connection credentials
4. Configure which data to sync
5. Start querying your data with natural language

---

## Connection Requirements

### Prerequisites

- MongoDB cluster (Atlas, self-hosted, or cloud provider)
- Database user with read permissions
- Network access to your MongoDB cluster

### Required Information

- **Connection URL** - MongoDB connection string in format:
  ```
  mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
  ```
- **Auth Source** (optional, defaults to `admin`)
- **Database Name** - Specific database to index
- **Cluster Name** (optional, for Atlas clusters)

---

## What Gets Indexed

Alchemyst can index and make searchable:

- **Collections** - All documents within specified collections
- **Documents** - Individual records with all fields
- **Aggregation Results** - Pipeline outputs and computed data
- **Embedded Documents** - Nested data structures
- **Array Fields** - List data and sub-documents

---

## How Data is Structured

When you sync MongoDB collections, Alchemyst preserves your document structure while optimizing for search:

### Hierarchical Organization

```javascript
// Example: User profiles collection
groupName: ["database", "mongodb", "user_profiles"]
metadata: {
  collectionId: "user_profiles",
  userId: "user_abc123",
  accountType: "premium",
  region: "us-east"
}
content: `
  User Profile: Jane Smith
  
  Account Details:
  - Email: jane.smith@example.com
  - Account Type: Premium
  - Member Since: January 2024
  - Region: US East
  
  Preferences:
  - Notifications: Email, Push
  - Theme: Dark mode
  - Language: English
  
  Activity Summary:
  - Last Login: 2024-12-29
  - Total Sessions: 245
  - Feature Usage: Analytics (Daily), Reports (Weekly)
`
```

### Example Query Patterns

```
"Find all premium users in the US region"
→ Filters: metadata.accountType="premium", metadata.region="us-east"

"What features do active users prefer?"
→ Semantic search across user preferences and activity data

"Show recent user feedback"
→ Time-filtered search in feedback collection
```

## How to Connect

1. Go to [Alchemyst Integrations](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=mongodb_setup&utm_medium=web)
2. Click **Add Integration** → **MongoDB**
3. Enter your connection details:
   - MongoDB connection URI
   - Select collections to index
4. Test the connection
5. Configure sync settings
6. Save and activate the integration

## Connection String Examples

### MongoDB Atlas

```
mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/mydb?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### Self-Hosted MongoDB

```
mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017/database?authSource=admin
```

### MongoDB with Replica Set

```
mongodb://user:password@host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/database?replicaSet=myReplicaSet
```

## Best Practices

- **Use read-only roles** - Create users with `read` role only
- **Enable authentication** - Always use authenticated connections
- **Use connection pooling** - Improve performance for large collections
- **Filter collections** - Index only necessary data to reduce load
- **Monitor queries** - Track slow operations and optimize as needed

---

## Security Best Practices

### Access Control

- **Use read-only credentials** - Prevent accidental data modification
- **Create dedicated service accounts** - Separate Alchemyst access from application users
- **Apply principle of least privilege** - Grant access only to required collections

### Network Security

- **Enable SSL/TLS encryption** - Protect data in transit
- **Whitelist Alchemyst IPs** - Restrict database access by IP address
- **Use private networks** - Connect via VPN or private peering when possible
- **Enable firewall rules** - Block unauthorized access attempts
