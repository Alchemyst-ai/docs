description: "Connect PostgreSQL databases to your Alchemyst context layer"

## Overview

PostgreSQL is the most popular open-source relational database, commonly used for:

- Customer records and CRM data
- Product catalogs and inventory
- Transaction logs and financial data
- Application state and configuration

## Why Connect PostgreSQL?

Traditional AI agents struggle with operational data because:

- **Data changes constantly** - Static exports become outdated quickly
- **Manual exports go stale** - Syncing requires constant maintenance  
- **Querying requires SQL knowledge** - Non-technical users can't access data easily

With Alchemyst PostgreSQL integration, you can:

- Sync fresh data whenever context is needed
- Search semantically across tables and collections
- Combine database results with other data sources
- Query in natural language without writing SQL

Your databases become queryable context that responds to meaning, not just raw data.

## Getting Started

To connect PostgreSQL to Alchemyst:

1. Navigate to the [Alchemyst Integrations page](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=postgresql_docs&utm_medium=web)
2. Click **Add Integration** → **PostgreSQL**
3. Provide your connection credentials
4. Configure which data to sync
5. Start querying your data with natural language

---

## Connection Requirements

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL instance (local, cloud-hosted, or managed service)
- Read-only database user (strongly recommended)
- Network access to your PostgreSQL instance

### Required Information

- **Connection String** - Full PostgreSQL URL in format:
  ```
  postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
  ```
- **Username** (optional if included in URL)
- **Password** (optional if included in URL)  
- **Database Name** (optional if included in URL)
- **Port** (default: 5432)

---

## What Gets Indexed

Alchemyst can index and make searchable:

- **Tables** - All rows and columns from specified tables
- **Views** - Materialized and regular views
- **Query Results** - Custom SQL query outputs
- **Schema Definitions** - Table structures and relationships
- **Stored Procedures** - Procedure outputs and results

---

## How Data is Structured

When you sync PostgreSQL tables, Alchemyst automatically structures your data for optimal retrieval:

### Example Query Patterns

```
"Show me all high-priority support tickets from last month"
→ Filters: groupName includes "support_tickets", metadata.priority="high"

"Find customer payment issues"
→ Semantic search across content for payment-related problems

"What's the resolution pattern for login errors?"
→ Retrieves similar resolved tickets and identifies common solutions
```

## How to Connect

1. Go to [Alchemyst Integrations](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=postgresql_setup&utm_medium=web)
2. Click **Add Integration** → **PostgreSQL**
3. Enter your connection details:
   - Connection string or individual credentials
   - Select tables or provide custom queries
4. Test the connection
5. Configure sync frequency and data filters
6. Save and activate the integration

## Connection String Examples

### Local PostgreSQL

```
postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb
```

### Cloud PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)

```
postgresql://admin:password@mydb.abc123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/production
```

### Google Cloud SQL

```
postgresql://user:password@/database?host=/cloudsql/project:region:instance
```

## Best Practices

- **Use read-only users** - Create a dedicated service account with `SELECT` permissions only
- **Enable SSL/TLS** - Always use encrypted connections for production data
- **Whitelist IPs** - Restrict database access to Alchemyst service IPs
- **Index strategically** - Start with critical tables, expand as needed
- **Monitor performance** - Watch for slow queries or high load

---

## Security Best Practices

### Access Control

- **Use read-only credentials** - Prevent accidental data modification
- **Create dedicated service accounts** - Separate Alchemyst access from application users
- **Apply principle of least privilege** - Grant access only to required tables/collections

### Network Security

- **Enable SSL/TLS encryption** - Protect data in transit
- **Whitelist Alchemyst IPs** - Restrict database access by IP address
- **Use private networks** - Connect via VPN or private peering when possible
- **Enable firewall rules** - Block unauthorized access attempts
