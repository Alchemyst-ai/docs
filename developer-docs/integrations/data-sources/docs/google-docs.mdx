## Introduction

Google Docs is the most popular collaborative document editor, commonly used for meeting notes, project documentation, SOPs, knowledge base articles, and onboarding guides.

With Alchemyst's [Google Docs integration](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs.getalchemystai.com&utm_campaign=docs&utm_medium=web), you can sync documents anytime you want, search semantically across all your docs, and share team knowledge across collaborators.

Your agent sees documents as living knowledge, not static files.

***

## Why Connect Google Docs?

Traditional document workflows fail because:

* Documents are scattered across drives
* Manual exports become stale immediately
* There's no way to query across multiple docs
* Collaboration happens outside agent context

With Alchemyst's Google Docs integration, your documents sync directly into your context layer, enabling seamless collaboration and always up-to-date information.

## How to Connect

**Prerequisites:**

* Google Cloud Project
* Service Account with Google Docs API access
* Documents shared with the service account email

**What You Need:**

* Client Email (service account email address)
* Private Key (from service account JSON key file)
* Shared Document URL

**Important:** You must share each document or folder with the service account email address. The service account needs at least Viewer permission to access the content.

## What Gets Indexed

Alchemyst can index:

* Document text
* Formatting
* Comments
* Suggestions
* Embedded images
* Links
* Version history

***

## Setting Up a Service Account

1. Go to Google Cloud Console and create or select a project
2. Enable Google Docs API
3. Navigate to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts
4. Create a new service account
5. Generate a JSON key file
6. Extract the `client_email` and `private_key` from the JSON

**The JSON key file contains:**

* `client_email`: Service account email (e.g., `service@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
* `private_key`: Full private key string (including header and footer)

***

## Security Best Practices

For Google Docs integrations:

* Use service accounts instead of OAuth for programmatic access
* Store private keys in environment variables or secrets managers
* Never commit private keys to version control
* Rotate keys every 90 days
* Grant only Viewer permissions to service accounts
* Use folder-level sharing for easier management
* Enable access logging in Google Workspace Admin Console
* Monitor for unusual activity and set up alerts

***

## Version Tracking

Google Docs change constantly. Alchemyst automatically tracks versions by removing old content when documents update and indexing new content, ensuring searches always return the latest information.

***

## Next Steps

Once Google Docs is connected, you can:

* Search across all your documents
* Combine document data with databases and other sources
* Keep your agent synchronized with team collaboration
