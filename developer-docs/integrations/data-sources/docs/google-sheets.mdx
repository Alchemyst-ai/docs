## Introduction

Google Sheets is a collaborative spreadsheet tool, commonly used for project tracking, budgets, customer lists, experiment results, and configuration data.

With Alchemyst's [Google Sheets integration](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs.getalchemystai.com&utm_campaign=docs&utm_medium=web), you can sync spreadsheets anytime you want, search semantically across all your sheets, and query sheets like structured databases.

Your agent sees spreadsheets as living knowledge, not static files.

***

## Why Connect Google Sheets?

Traditional spreadsheet workflows fail because:

* Spreadsheets are scattered across drives
* Manual exports become stale immediately
* There's no way to query across multiple sheets
* Collaboration happens outside agent context

With Alchemyst's Google Sheets integration, your spreadsheets sync directly into your context layer, enabling seamless collaboration and always up-to-date information.

## How to Connect

**Prerequisites:**

* Google Cloud Project
* Service Account with Google Sheets API access
* Spreadsheets shared with the service account email

**What You Need:**

* Client Email (service account email address)
* Private Key (from service account JSON key file)
* Spreadsheet URL

**Important:** You must share the spreadsheet with the service account email address. The service account needs at least Viewer permission to access the content.

## What Gets Indexed

Alchemyst can index:

* Cell values
* Formulas
* Named ranges
* Sheet names
* Structure
* Charts (as text descriptions)
* Comments

***

## Setting Up a Service Account

1. Go to Google Cloud Console and create or select a project
2. Enable Google Sheets API
3. Navigate to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts
4. Create a new service account
5. Generate a JSON key file
6. Extract the `client_email` and `private_key` from the JSON

**The JSON key file contains:**

* `client_email`: Service account email (e.g., `service@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
* `private_key`: Full private key string (including header and footer)

***

## Security Best Practices

For Google Sheets integrations:

* Use service accounts instead of OAuth for programmatic access
* Store private keys in environment variables or secrets managers
* Never commit private keys to version control
* Rotate keys every 90 days
* Grant only Viewer permissions to service accounts
* Use folder-level sharing for easier management
* Enable access logging in Google Workspace Admin Console
* Monitor for unusual activity and set up alerts

***

## Version Tracking

Google Sheets change constantly. Alchemyst automatically tracks versions by removing old content when spreadsheets update and indexing new content, ensuring searches always return the latest information.

## Next Steps

Once Google Sheets is connected, you can:

* Search across all your spreadsheets
* Combine spreadsheet data with databases and other sources
* Keep your agent synchronized with team collaboration
