## Overview

Data source integrations bring your organization's knowledge directly into Alchemyst. Instead of manually uploading files or copying data, connect your existing systems and let Alchemyst automatically sync and search across everything.

**Three ways to connect your data:**

-  **[Databases](#databases)** - PostgreSQL, MongoDB
-  **[Productivity Tools](#productivity-tools)** - Google Docs, Google Sheets
-  **[Cloud Storage](#cloud-storage)** - Amazon S3

Once connected, query all your data in natural language. No SQL required. No manual exports. Just ask questions and get answers.

---

## Why Connect Your Data Sources?

**Without integrations, you're stuck with:**
- Manually exporting files that go stale immediately
- Copy-pasting content between systems
- Searching one place at a time
- Data scattered across dozens of tools
- No way for non-technical users to access databases

---

## Databases

Connect relational and NoSQL databases to query operational data in natural language.

### PostgreSQL

Connect your PostgreSQL database to query operational data without writing SQL.

**Common use cases:**
- Customer records and CRM data
- Product catalogs and inventory
- Transaction history and financial records
- Support tickets and resolutions
- Application data and logs

### MongoDB

Connect your MongoDB database to search documents and collections in natural language.

**Common use cases:**
- User profiles and account data
- Content management systems
- Event logs and analytics
- Customer feedback and reviews
- Application settings and configuration

## Productivity Tools

Sync collaborative documents and spreadsheets to keep your agent synchronized with team knowledge.

### Google Docs

Sync your team's Google Docs so everyone can search across shared knowledge.

**Common use cases:**
- Meeting notes and decisions
- Project documentation
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
- Product requirements and specs
- Onboarding guides and training materials

**What you can do:**
- "Find meeting notes about the Q4 product launch"
- "What's our process for handling customer escalations?"
- "Show me all onboarding documentation for engineers"
- "What decisions were made in the leadership meeting last week?"

**What gets synced:** Document text, comments, and suggestions. Version history is tracked automatically so searches always return the latest content.

### Google Sheets

Query your spreadsheets like a database, no formulas required.

**Common use cases:**
- Project tracking and roadmaps
- Budget planning and expense tracking
- Customer lists and contact databases
- Experiment results and metrics
- Inventory and resource management

**What you can do:**
- "What's our total marketing spend for Q1?"
- "Find all projects that are behind schedule"
- "Show me the top 10 customers by revenue"
- "Which experiments showed positive results last month?"

**What gets synced:** Cell values, formulas, and sheet structure. Search across all your sheets or query specific ranges.

## Cloud Storage

Ingest files, documents, and media from object storage systems into your context layer.

### Amazon S3

Connect your S3 buckets to search across all your files and documents.

**Common use cases:**
- Document archives and file repositories
- Product specifications and technical docs
- Media libraries and marketing assets
- Data exports and reports
- Code repositories and documentation

**What you can do:**
- "Find all quarterly financial reports from 2024"
- "Search product spec PDFs for features related to authentication"
- "Show me customer data exports from last week"
- "Find all marketing images tagged with 'product-launch'"

**Supported file types:**
- **Documents:** PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, MD
- **Data:** CSV, JSON, JSONL, XML, Parquet, YAML
- **Images:** PNG, JPG, SVG (with text extraction)
- **Code:** All text-based source files

## How It Works

### 1. Connect in Minutes

Visit the [Alchemyst Integrations page](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=intro&utm_medium=web), select your data source, and enter your credentials. Most integrations take less than 5 minutes to set up.

### 2. Choose What to Sync

Select which databases, documents, or buckets to sync. You control exactly what data Alchemyst can access.

### 3. Data Syncs Automatically

Alchemyst indexes your data and keeps it up-to-date. Set your sync frequency—real-time, hourly, daily, or on-demand.

### 4. Search Everything at Once

Ask questions in plain English. Alchemyst searches across all your connected sources and combines results intelligently.

**Example:** "Find customer feedback about our mobile app from the last 30 days"
- Searches support ticket database (PostgreSQL)
- Searches feedback collection (MongoDB)
- Searches team notes (Google Docs)
- Returns unified results ranked by relevance

---

## Security

Your data security is our priority. All integrations follow enterprise-grade security standards:

-  **Read-only access** - Alchemyst can only read your data, never modify or delete it
-  **Encrypted connections** - All data transfers use SSL/TLS encryption
-  **Minimal permissions** - Grant access only to the specific data you want to sync
-  **Your control** - Disconnect any integration instantly from your dashboard
-  **Credential security** - All credentials are encrypted at rest and in transit

We recommend creating dedicated service accounts with read-only permissions for all integrations. Detailed security setup instructions are provided for each integration type.
