## Overview

Database integrations allow you to sync structured and semi-structured data directly into your Alchemyst context layer. Instead of relying on manual exports or stale snapshots, connect your live databases and pull fresh data on-demand.

## Why Connect Databases?

Traditional AI agents struggle with operational data because:

- **Data changes constantly** - Static exports become outdated quickly
- **Manual exports go stale** - Syncing requires constant maintenance  
- **Querying requires SQL knowledge** - Non-technical users can't access data easily

With Alchemyst database integrations, you can:

-  Sync fresh data whenever context is needed
-  Search semantically across tables and collections
-  Combine database results with other data sources
-  Query in natural language without writing SQL

Your databases become queryable context that responds to meaning, not just raw data.

## Getting Started

![Database Integration Setup](../../images/integrations1.jpeg)

To connect a database to Alchemyst:

1. Navigate to the [Alchemyst Integrations page](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=database_docs&utm_medium=web)
2. Select your database type (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
3. Provide your connection credentials
4. Configure which data to sync
5. Start querying your data with natural language

---

## PostgreSQL Integration

PostgreSQL is the most popular open-source relational database, commonly used for:

- Customer records and CRM data
- Product catalogs and inventory
- Transaction logs and financial data
- Application state and configuration

### Connection Requirements

**Prerequisites:**

- PostgreSQL instance (local, cloud-hosted, or managed service)
- Read-only database user (strongly recommended)
- Network access to your PostgreSQL instance

**Required Information:**

- **Connection String** - Full PostgreSQL URL in format:
  ```
  postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
  ```
- **Username** (optional if included in URL)
- **Password** (optional if included in URL)  
- **Database Name** (optional if included in URL)
- **Port** (default: 5432)

### What Gets Indexed

Alchemyst can index and make searchable:

- **Tables** - All rows and columns from specified tables
- **Views** - Materialized and regular views
- **Query Results** - Custom SQL query outputs
- **Schema Definitions** - Table structures and relationships
- **Stored Procedures** - Procedure outputs and results

### How Data is Structured

When you sync PostgreSQL tables, Alchemyst automatically structures your data for optimal retrieval:

**Hierarchical Organization:**
```javascript
// Example: Customer support database
groupName: ["database", "postgres", "support_tickets"]
metadata: {
  tableId: "support_tickets",
  recordId: "ticket_1234",
  status: "resolved",
  priority: "high"
}
content: `
  Ticket #1234: Cannot access dashboard
  Customer: John Doe (john@example.com)
  Issue: User reports "Access Denied" error when logging in
  Resolution: Password reset link sent, issue resolved
  Assigned to: Support Team
  Created: 2024-12-29 | Resolved: 2024-12-29
`
```

**Example Query Patterns:**
```
"Show me all high-priority support tickets from last month"
→ Filters: groupName includes "support_tickets", metadata.priority="high"

"Find customer payment issues"
→ Semantic search across content for payment-related problems

"What's the resolution pattern for login errors?"
→ Retrieves similar resolved tickets and identifies common solutions
```

### How to Connect

1. Go to [Alchemyst Integrations](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=postgresql_setup&utm_medium=web)
2. Click **Add Integration** → **PostgreSQL**
3. Enter your connection details:
   - Connection string or individual credentials
   - Select tables or provide custom queries
4. Test the connection
5. Configure sync frequency and data filters
6. Save and activate the integration

### Connection String Examples

**Local PostgreSQL:**
```
postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb
```

### Best Practices

- **Use read-only users** - Create a dedicated service account with `SELECT` permissions only
- **Enable SSL/TLS** - Always use encrypted connections for production data
- **Whitelist IPs** - Restrict database access to Alchemyst service IPs
- **Index strategically** - Start with critical tables, expand as needed
- **Monitor performance** - Watch for slow queries or high load

---

## MongoDB Integration

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database, ideal for:

- User profiles and account data
- Content management systems
- Event logs and analytics
- Flexible schema applications

### Connection Requirements

**Prerequisites:**

- MongoDB cluster (Atlas, self-hosted, or cloud provider)
- Database user with read permissions
- Network access to your MongoDB cluster

**Required Information:**

- **Connection URL** - MongoDB connection string in format:
  ```
  mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
  ```
- **Auth Source** (optional, defaults to `admin`)
- **Database Name** - Specific database to index
- **Cluster Name** (optional, for Atlas clusters)

### What Gets Indexed

Alchemyst can index and make searchable:

- **Collections** - All documents within specified collections
- **Documents** - Individual records with all fields
- **Aggregation Results** - Pipeline outputs and computed data
- **Embedded Documents** - Nested data structures
- **Array Fields** - List data and sub-documents

### How Data is Structured

When you sync MongoDB collections, Alchemyst preserves your document structure while optimizing for search:

**Hierarchical Organization:**
```javascript
// Example: User profiles collection
groupName: ["database", "mongodb", "user_profiles"]
metadata: {
  collectionId: "user_profiles",
  userId: "user_abc123",
  accountType: "premium",
  region: "us-east"
}
content: `
  User Profile: Jane Smith
  
  Account Details:
  - Email: jane.smith@example.com
  - Account Type: Premium
  - Member Since: January 2024
  - Region: US East
  
  Preferences:
  - Notifications: Email, Push
  - Theme: Dark mode
  - Language: English
  
  Activity Summary:
  - Last Login: 2024-12-29
  - Total Sessions: 245
  - Feature Usage: Analytics (Daily), Reports (Weekly)
`
```
**Example Query Patterns:**
```
"Find all premium users in the US region"
→ Filters: metadata.accountType="premium", metadata.region="us-east"

"What features do active users prefer?"
→ Semantic search across user preferences and activity data

"Show recent user feedback"
→ Time-filtered search in feedback collection
```

### How to Connect

1. Go to [Alchemyst Integrations](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=mongodb_setup&utm_medium=web)
2. Click **Add Integration** → **MongoDB**
3. Enter your connection details:
   - MongoDB connection URI
   - Select collections to index
4. Test the connection
5. Configure sync settings
6. Save and activate the integration

### Connection String Examples

**MongoDB Atlas:**
```
mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/mydb?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**Self-Hosted MongoDB:**
```
mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017/database?authSource=admin
```

### Best Practices

- **Use read-only roles** - Create users with `read` role only
- **Enable authentication** - Always use authenticated connections
- **Use connection pooling** - Improve performance for large collections
- **Filter collections** - Index only necessary data to reduce load
- **Monitor queries** - Track slow operations and optimize as needed

---

## Security Best Practices

For all database integrations, follow these security guidelines:

### Access Control

-  **Use read-only credentials** - Prevent accidental data modification
-  **Create dedicated service accounts** - Separate Alchemyst access from application users
-  **Apply principle of least privilege** - Grant access only to required tables/collections

### Network Security

-  **Enable SSL/TLS encryption** - Protect data in transit
-  **Whitelist Alchemyst IPs** - Restrict database access by IP address
-  **Use private networks** - Connect via VPN or private peering when possible
-  **Enable firewall rules** - Block unauthorized access attempts

---

**Result:** Developers can search "user authentication endpoint" and find implementation details.
