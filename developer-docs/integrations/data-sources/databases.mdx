## Introduction

Database integrations allow you to sync structured and semi-structured data directly into your Alchemyst context layer. Connect your live databases and pull fresh data on-demand instead of relying on manual exports or stale snapshots.

## Why Connect Databases?

Traditional agents struggle with operational data because data changes constantly, manual exports go stale quickly, and querying requires SQL knowledge. 

With Alchemyst [database integrations](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/integrations?utm_source=docs.getalchemystai.com&utm_campaign=docs&utm_medium=web), you can:

- Sync fresh data whenever context is needed
- Search semantically across tables and collections
- Combine database results with other data sources
- Query in natural language without writing SQL

Your databases become queryable context that responds to meaning, not just raw data.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the most popular open-source relational database, commonly used for customer records, product catalogs, transaction logs, and application state.

### How to Connect

**Prerequisites:**
- PostgreSQL instance (local or cloud-hosted)
- Read-only database user (recommended)
- PostgreSQL connection string with credentials

**What You Need:**
- Connection String (full PostgreSQL URI)
- Username (optional if included in URI)
- Database Name (optional if included in URI)

Alchemyst can index tables, views, query results, schema definitions, and stored procedure outputs.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database, ideal for user profiles, content management systems, event logs, and flexible schema data.

### How to Connect

**Prerequisites:**
- MongoDB cluster (Atlas, self-hosted, or cloud provider)
- Database user with read permissions
- MongoDB connection URI

**What You Need:**
- Connection URI (MongoDB connection string)
- Auth Source (optional, defaults to `admin`)
- Cluster Name (optional, for Atlas clusters)

Alchemyst can index collections, documents, aggregation pipeline results, and embedded documents with nested data.

## Security Best Practices

For all database integrations:

- Use read-only credentials to prevent accidental data modification
- Create dedicated service accounts for Alchemyst access
- Enable SSL/TLS encryption for all connections
- Whitelist Alchemyst service IPs or use private networks
- Rotate credentials regularly using secrets managers
- Enable database audit logs to monitor access

## Next Steps

Once your databases are connected, you can search across your data semantically, combine database results with documents and other sources, and keep your agent's knowledge synchronized with live data.
