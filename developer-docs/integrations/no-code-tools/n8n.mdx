This guide shows how to connect n8n to Alchemyst's REST API, so every automation you build can read and write context.

## Prerequisites

- An n8n account (cloud or self-hosted)
- An Alchemyst API key from the [dashboard](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/settings)
- Basic familiarity with n8n’s node editor

## Connect n8n to Alchemyst

### Setting Up the HTTP Request Node

1. Add an **HTTP Request** node anywhere in your workflow.
2. Under **Authentication**, pick **Generic Credential Type → Bearer Token**.
3. Create a credential, paste your Alchemyst API key, and save it.
4. Set **Method** to `POST` and **Content Type** to `JSON`.
5. Use one of these endpoints:
   - Add context: `https://platform-backend.getalchemystai.com/api/v1/context/add`
   - Search context: `https://platform-backend.getalchemystai.com/api/v1/context/search`

<Tip>
Re-use the same HTTP Request node as a template by duplicating it inside other workflows.
</Tip>

### Setting Up the MCP Node

1. Add an **MCP** node in your workflow by pasting the below code snippet.
```json
{
  "name": "Alchemyst MCP Client",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "alchemyst-mcp-client-1",
      "name": "Alchemyst MCP Client",
      "type": "@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcpClientTool",
      "typeVersion": 1.2,
      "position": [300, 300],
      "parameters": {
        "endpointUrl": "https://mcp.getalchemystai.com/mcp/sse",
        "serverTransport": "sse",
        "authentication": "bearerAuth",
        "include": "selected",
        "includeTools": [
          "alchemyst_ai_context_mcp_search_context"
        ],
        "options": {
          "timeout": 60000
        }
      },
      "credentials": {
        "httpBearerAuth": {
          "id": "",
          "name": ""
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "connections": {}
}
```
2. Open the node you just added and confirm the following settings:
   - **Endpoint**: `https://mcp.getalchemystai.com/mcp/sse`
   - **Authentication**: **Bearer Auth**
3. Create a Bearer Auth credential:
   - Click **Create New Credential**
   - Paste your Alchemyst API key into the **Bearer Token** field
   - Save the credential and select it for the MCP node

Once these steps are complete, the MCP node can call Alchemyst tools inside your workflows.
