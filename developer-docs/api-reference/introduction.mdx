## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication


To obtain your **API key**, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **[Alchemyst Platform](https://platform.getalchemystai.com)** and sign up using your **Google account**.  
2. After logging in, navigate to the **Get Started** section to generate your API key.  
3. You can also view and manage your API keys anytime from the **Settings** page.

Use the following authentication schema when making API requests:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
