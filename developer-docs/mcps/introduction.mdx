# What is the MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.
Using MCP, AI applications like Claude or ChatGPT can connect to data sources (e.g. local files, databases), tools (e.g. search engines, calculators) and workflows (e.g. specialized prompts)—enabling them to access key information and perform tasks.

{/* Let's say you are using any ai tool like Cursor, claude desktop , vscode etc. and you are stuck some where in between and ai is not
 aware of what to do next. and you don't have any idea about the thing in this situation you might need to train ai with the relavent data or build your own ai model. just joking you don't need to do all that rather what ypou can do is use upload the relavent docs or relavent files which you have regarding the concept where ai is stuck and upload them to the context processor in the alchemystai platform and then you can use them locally by integrating our mcp to the tool you are using now ai have the context and the memory it needs to perform better and serv you with better results. */}
