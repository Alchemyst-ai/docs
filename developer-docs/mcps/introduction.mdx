## The Context Layer as Infrastructure

At its core, Alchemyst functions as a **centralized context service**.

Instead of embedding documents, files, or historical interactions directly into prompts, Alchemyst stores context externally and exposes it through structured interfaces. These interfaces allow AI tools and agents to retrieve only the **most relevant information** at the moment it is needed.

This approach decouples:
- context storage from model execution  
- memory from individual tools  
- knowledge from single-session interactions  

The result is AI behavior that is more consistent, scalable, and reliable over time.

## MCP Compatibility: How Tools Connect to Alchemyst

Alchemyst's memory layer behaves like an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**.

It exposes well-defined APIs and tool interfaces that can be connected to MCP-compatible clients such as:
- VS Code
- Cursor
- Claude Desktop
- Custom agents or internal tooling

Through MCP, external tools can:
- store context (documents, conversations, instructions)
- fetch relevant memory at query time
- reuse the same context across multiple environments

This ensures that context is **portable**, not locked to a single editor or AI product.

## What Is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.

It defines how AI tools can securely interact with:
- data sources (files, databases, APIs)
- external tools (search, computation, automation)
- workflows and long-lived memory systems

Using MCP, AI applications like Claude or Cursor can operate with **shared, persistent context** instead of isolated, stateless prompts.

## Benefits of MCP-Based Context Integration

Integrating Alchemyst via MCP provides several practical advantages:

- **Persistent project knowledge**  
  Coding conventions, architectural decisions, and domain rules remain consistent across sessions.

- **Faster iteration**  
  The AI no longer needs repeated explanations of APIs, schemas, or prior decisions.

- **Cross-tool continuity**  
  The same memory is available in VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-enabled tools.

- **Reduced prompt overhead**  
  Context is retrieved dynamically instead of being manually injected into every prompt.

Conceptually, this is like working with a teammate who already understands the project—without constant re-onboarding.

## How Alchemyst + MCP Improves Real Workflows

Consider a common scenario:  
You're working inside an AI-powered editor and hit a point where the model lacks sufficient context to help you move forward.

Without a context layer, your options are limited:
- re-explain the problem
- paste large files into prompts
- accept shallow or incorrect responses

With Alchemyst, the workflow changes.

You upload the relevant files, documents, or references to Alchemyst's context processor. Once connected via MCP, the AI tool can retrieve that information on demand—locally, inside the editor.

No retraining.  
No custom models.  
No prompt stuffing.

The AI simply has access to the context it was missing.

---

## Design Principle

> **Context should be stored once, retrieved selectively, and reused everywhere.**

Alchemyst operationalizes this principle by treating memory as shared infrastructure rather than transient prompt data.

---

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Alchemyst with an MCP-enabled tool, ensure the following:

| **Requirement** | **Details** |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Alchemyst API access** | A valid API key and required credentials |
| **Context service endpoint** | URL or command to access the memory layer (local or hosted) |
| **Supported editor or tool** | VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, or another MCP-compatible client |
| **Permissions & scopes** | Read/write access to the context store as needed |
| **Secrets management** | API keys stored securely via environment variables or editor secrets |
| **Local dependencies** | Node.js, Python, or other runtime if running services locally |
| **Network access** | Required for HTTP/SSE-based MCP transports |

---

## Summary

Alchemyst provides a shared, persistent context layer for AI systems.  
MCP provides the protocol that allows tools to use it.

Together, they enable AI workflows that are:
- context-aware
- tool-agnostic
- scalable
- and far more reliable than prompt-based approaches
