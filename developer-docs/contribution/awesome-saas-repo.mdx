## What are AI agents?

AI agents are modular programs that combine models, tools, and memory to perform higher‑level tasks. In this repository, an **agent** is a self‑contained folder under `agents/` that bundles code, configuration, and documentation so builders can run, extend, or deploy a specific AI workflow — for example: newsletter generation, document summarization, or ticket triage.

Agents can be delivered as CLI tools, serverless API routes, bots, or full SaaS templates that integrate with the Alchemyst AI Platform.


## Quick Guide

This guide explains how to prepare and submit your AI agent so it can be featured in the Awesome-SaaS collection.

* Eligibility requirements to appear in the Awesome‑SaaS listing.
* Required files and metadata so the automated generator can discover your project.
* How to open a focused PR and what to include in the description for a smooth review.
* Contributor-focused troubleshooting steps if your project does not appear.

## Repository Overview

* **Root docs:** `README.md`, `index.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
* **Agents:** each agent lives in `agents/` and should include a `README.md` and a dependency manifest (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.).
* **Generators:** `list.js` and `leaderboard.js` produce the public listing and contributor leaderboard.
* **Community leaderboard:** see `leaderboard/README.md` for maintainer notes.



## How to prepare your project (step‑by‑step)

Follow these steps to make your project eligible for the Awesome-SaaS listing and easy for maintainers and other builders to evaluate.

1. **Make the repository public**
   * Ensure the repository is **public on GitHub** so the listing script can discover it.
2. **Add the repository topic**
   * Add the exact topic `alchemyst-awesome-saas` to your repo
3. **Provide a clear `README.md` that includes**:

   * One‑line description.
   * Quick install & run steps.
   * Example usage and a short **Why this helps builders** paragraph.
   * Required environment variables and a sample `.env.example`.
   * License information.

4. **Keep the agent self-contained**
   Put all runtime files and manifests inside `agents/<your-agent>/`, including:
   * Dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`).
   * Config samples (e.g., `.env.example`).
   * A minimal runnable demo or reproducible example so reviewers can confirm it runs locally.
5. **Add helpful extras** (optional but recommended)

   * Screenshots or a short demo GIF.
   * CI (GitHub Actions) with basic smoke tests.
   * README badges (build, license, version).
   * Additional topic tags describing the agent’s domain.


## Recommended folder layout

This is where all community-contributed AI agents live. Each sub-folder here contains an agent built using the Alchemyst AI Platform, whether it’s a CLI agent, SaaS prototype, or something experimental with Memory AI.
```
agents/
├── email-agent/
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── main.py
│ ├── requirements.txt
│ └── ...
├── chatbot-agent/
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── app.js
│ └── ...
└── ...
```


## PR & Contribution checklist

* Create a feature branch (e.g. `feature/docs-community` or `feature/community-<your-project>`).
* Keep PRs focused: one doc or feature per PR.
* Confirm `alchemyst-awesome-saas` is added to your repository topics.
* Add links to your project in the PR description and request the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label if you want the PR to count for Hacktoberfest.


## Examples
- [B2b-newsletter-writer](https://docs.getalchemystai.com/example-projects/community/b2b-newsletter-writer) - The **B2B Newsletter AI Agent** is a SaaS prototype that automatically generates audience-focused newsletters for businesses using the Alchemyst AI Platform
- [Discord-bot](https://docs.getalchemystai.com/example-projects/community/discord-bot) - A simple Discord bot powered by [Alchemyst AI SDK](https://docs.getalchemystai.com/integrations/sdk/typescript-sdk) and OpenAI. The bot stores conversation context and provides smart answers to users’ questions in direct messages.

## Troubleshooting
- Keep your agent self-contained (all dependencies in its own folder).
- Include a clear `README.md` with:
   * What the agent does
   * Setup steps
   * Example usage
- Stay aligned with the repo’s theme (AI Agents, AI SaaS, Agentic AI, Memory AI).
- Avoid broken, incomplete, or irrelevant code.
