At **Alchemyst AI**, we provide AI applications with the context they need to become **smarter**, more **accurate**, and more **useful**. This page explains the proposed scope and outline for the Context Processor, gives a concise top-level view of how the system works, highlights technical insights and their implications, and shows practical examples and use-cases.


## Overview

**Alchemyst** automatically converts your data into retrievable **context** that enhances model reasoning and memory. The platform works as follows:

1. **Ingest:** Bring data from databases, files, user interactions, and external APIs.  
2. **Enrich & Index:** Normalize and enrich data, then index it for fast retrieval by your agents or LLM prompts.  
3. **Serve Context:** Provide contextual snippets and memories to models at inference time.  
4. **Orchestrate:** Chain tools and services to create deterministic workflows and agent behaviors.  
5. **Persist & Evolve:** Store user- or application-level memory that can be updated and audited over time.


## System Requirements

1. **Inputs**: Documents (PDF, HTML, text, markdown, JSON), required metadata (organization, project, tags), and query text
2. **Outputs**: AI responses augmented with source citations, relevance scores, and structured data when applicable
3. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and graceful degradation when issues occur


## Key Features
 - **Context API**: Manage context data with user and organization-level access control, ensuring that your AI agents can maintain context and intent.

- **Context Proxy API**: An OpenAI-compatible proxy API that offers intelligent context filtering and chat completion capabilities, enhancing message relevance processing.

- **MCP Support**: Connect directly to Claude or OpenAI with MCPs, and get started with context-rich responses in 3 minutes!

## Use Cases
1. **Customer Support Knowledge Base**
* Upload product documentation, FAQs, and support tickets
* Get instant, accurate answers with source citations
* Reduce response time and improve consistency

2. **Engineering Code Assistant**
* Index code repositories, design docs, and API specifications
* Provide contextual code examples and explanations
* Accelerate developer onboarding and productivity

3. **Content Summarization**
* Process long-form content across multiple documents
* Generate executive summaries with source attributions
* Maintain consistent messaging across teams

## Getting Started 

1. **Create an account** on our platform: [Alchemyst AI](https://platform.getalchemystai.com).  
2. After signing up, **access the Context Processor** from your dashboard.  
3. **Upload your documents, files, or data** to provide the AI with the background it needs.  
4. Use the **Converse feature** to start getting context-aware responses instantly.  
5. **Integrate with your own applications** using our APIs. For details, check the [API Reference](https://docs.getalchemystai.com/api-reference/introduction). 


## Conclusion

**Alchemyst** simplifies the process of giving AI models the right **context** so they can reason **more accurately** using your own data. By transforming raw information into structured, retrievable context, it bridges the gap between static knowledge and dynamic intelligence.

Whether youâ€™re enhancing customer support, powering developer tools, or building compliance systems, the **Context Processor** provides a reliable foundation for **context-aware applications**.
