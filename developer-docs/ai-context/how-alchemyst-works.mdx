At **Alchemyst AI**, we provide AI applications with the context they need to become **smarter**, more **accurate**, and more **useful**. This page explains the proposed scope and outline for the Context Processor, gives a concise top-level view of how the system works, highlights technical insights and their implications, and shows practical examples and use-cases.


## Overview

**Alchemyst** converts your raw documents and data into retrievable **context** that augments model responses. The flow is:

1. **Ingest**: you upload documents, files, or connect a data source (S3, Google Drive, database export).
2. **Normalize & Parse**: files are parsed, normalized, and split into chunks suitable for embedding (chunking and metadata tagging).
3. **Encode & Index**: each chunk is encoded into a vector (embedding) and stored in an index (vector database) along with metadata.
4. **Retrieve**: at query time a retriever selects the most relevant chunks based on similarity, filters, and business rules.
5. **Compose Context**: retrieved chunks are ranked and composed into a compact context window with additional signals (recency, trust score, source attribution).
6. **Model Prompting & Response**: the assembled context is supplied to an LLM or reasoning engine which generates responses; optional grounding and citations are attached.
7. **Feedback & Iteration**: user feedback, corrections, and new data are fed back into the index to improve future retrieval.


## System Requirements

1. **Inputs**: Documents (PDF, HTML, text, markdown, JSON), required metadata (organization, project, tags), and query text
2. **Outputs**: AI responses augmented with source citations, relevance scores, and structured data when applicable
3. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and graceful degradation when issues occur


## Key Features
 - **Context API**: Manage context data with user and organization-level access control, ensuring that your AI agents can maintain context and intent.

- **Context Proxy API**: An OpenAI-compatible proxy API that offers intelligent context filtering and chat completion capabilities, enhancing message relevance processing.

- **MCP Support**: Connect directly to Claude or OpenAI with MCPs, and get started with context-rich responses in 3 minutes!

## Use Cases
1. **Customer Support Knowledge Base**
* Upload product documentation, FAQs, and support tickets
* Get instant, accurate answers with source citations
* Reduce response time and improve consistency

2. **Engineering Code Assistant**
* Index code repositories, design docs, and API specifications
* Provide contextual code examples and explanations
* Accelerate developer onboarding and productivity

3. **Content Summarization**

* Generate executive summaries with source attributions
* Maintain consistent messaging across teams

## Getting Started 

1. **Create an account** on our platform: [Alchemyst AI](https://platform.getalchemystai.com).  
2. After signing up, **access the Context Processor** from your dashboard.  
3. **Upload your documents, files, or data** to provide the AI with the background it needs.  
4. Use the **Converse feature** to start getting context-aware responses instantly.  
5. **Integrate with your own applications** using our APIs. For details, check the [API Reference](https://docs.getalchemystai.com/api-reference/introduction). 


## Conclusion

**Alchemyst** simplifies the process of giving AI models the right **context** so they can reason **more accurately** using your own data. By transforming raw information into structured, retrievable context, it bridges the gap between static knowledge and dynamic intelligence.

Whether youâ€™re enhancing customer support, powering developer tools, or building compliance systems, the **Context Processor** provides a reliable foundation for **context-aware applications**.
