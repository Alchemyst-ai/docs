## Overview

AI without context is like an assistant who shows up to work with no background on your business. It may give you answers, but theyâ€™ll often be too generic, incomplete, or even wrong.

AI Context solves this by providing the AI with the right information - your data, documents, workflows, and environment. With context, the AI can:

## Benefits

- Understand your specific needs instead of relying on broad assumptions.

- Deliver accurate and relevant outputs that match your goals.

- Save time by reducing back-and-forth explanations.

- Integrate seamlessly into your existing tools and processes.

## Conclusion

In short, context turns AI from a general assistant into a knowledgeable partner that works for your workflow.
