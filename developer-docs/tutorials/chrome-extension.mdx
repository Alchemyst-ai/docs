To take it a step further you can use **save context** button to save the current chat and use it as context across models.

### How it works :

- Consider this scenario, you are stuck solving an error you go to gpt explain your code, error, solutions you have tried and ask what are you missing out on. Gpt gives you some steps to try you try those, still doesn’t work.
- Frustrated you switch to claude, now the actual problem starts, re-explain your code, error, solutions you have tried and on top of that, the chat with chatgpt, not very efficient.
- So here we come to your rescue, just use the save context button, and switch effortlessly, it’s that EASY.

To use memory you need to add memory, to do that just drag and drop any document you would like to store as memory, can be a pdf, text file, json file, doc file.

## Use Cases :

As you are all set to use the extension let’s now look and some of the cool stuff you can do with it.

### **For Everyone :**

### **1. AI Models that actually remembers you**

Tired of AI models forgetting who you are every time you open a new chat? With Alchemyst AI memory, you can make it remember your preferences, goals, or habits. Whether it’s your fitness routine, favorite food, or daily schedule, AI Model will keep it in mind and talk like it actually knows you.

### **2. Continuous learning buddy**

If you are learning a new skill, language, or preparing for exams, you don’t need to start from scratch every session. AI Model will remember your progress, weak areas, and even your previous questions so it can build on them next time you open it.

### **3. Personal journal and reflection space**

Want to track your thoughts or daily reflections? You can use memory to keep your past entries. AI Model can summarize your week, analyze your writing tone, or give you insights on how your mindset has changed over time.

### **4. Smarter recommendations**

Every suggestion becomes better with memory. From movies, recipes, or books, AI Model will personalize recommendations based on what you’ve liked before, without you needing to remind it every time.

### **For Developers :**

### **1. Your AI coding partner with context**

Developers can finally stop re-explaining their stack, framework, and project setup in every session. Once AI Model remembers your project details, it can help you faster and more accurately the next time you ask for help.

### **2. Smarter debugging sessions**

No more “start from zero” debugging. AI Model will recall your previous error logs from alchemyst’s memory, the fixes you tried, and what worked or didn’t, so you can pick up where you left off seamlessly.

### **3. Technical writing made easier**

If you often write documentation, commit messages, or changelogs, adding a single reference doc on the platform can help gpt remember your team’s writing style and project tone. It can help you generate consistent documentation without having to guide it repeatedly.

### **4. Shared team memory**

Teams can share one memory setup for a project so every member gets the same context inside AI Model. Perfect for consistent onboarding, documentation, and communication across dev teams.

With Alchemyst AI’s Chrome extension, AI models becomes more than just a chatbot. It becomes your personal assistant, teacher, or coding partner that actually remembers what matters to you.
