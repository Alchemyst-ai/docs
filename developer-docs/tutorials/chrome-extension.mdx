## Alchemyst AI - Chrome Extension for AI Models.

Have you been tired of explaining the same things to different AI Models over and over again while hoping between them, and still it just doesn't get you. Well you don't have to worry about that anymore, we got you covered. All you need is Alchemyst AI's chrome extension and we handle the rest.

## Step By Step Setup :

Let's get you started with the extension quickly, I promise it will take less than a minute.

## **Installation**

1. **Download the Chrome Extension :** Grab the extension file [click here](https://github.com/Alchemyst-ai/chrome-extension) directly from the Chrome Web Store.
2. **Enable the Extension** after installation.

## **Set Up Your API Key**

1. Visit **Alchemyst AI :** [Platform](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/settings)
2. Copy your **API Key** from the settings page.
3. Open the **ChatGPT tab** in your browser and click the **Alchemyst AI extension icon**.
4. Paste your **API Key** into the input field.

## **Enable Alchemyst AI Memory**

After entering your key, look for the **Alchemyst AI memory toggle icon** inside the **ChatGPT message box,** Flip the switch to **ON** - and that's it!

Your chat sessions will now be enhanced with **Alchemyst AI's memory**- preserving important context across conversations

To take it a step further you can use **save context** button to save the current chat and use it as context across models.

## Saving context to the Alchemyst AI

- You can **turn memory ON or OFF** anytime by using the toggle in the message box.
