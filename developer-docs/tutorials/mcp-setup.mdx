## Overview

This tutorial shows how to integrate the **Alchemyst MCP** (Memory & Context Platform) server with **Visual Studio Code** and **GitHub Copilot** to give your AI tooling project-specific memory and documentation. MCP helps your AI suggestions stay aligned with PRDs, coding patterns, and team standards.


## Key Learnings 
- What MCP is and why context engineering matters for AI-assisted development.  
- How to install and configure an MCP server for VS Code workflows.  
- How to upload and link Product Requirement Documents (PRDs).  
- How to enable Agent Mode so Copilot receives project context in real time.  
- Practical benefits: improved accuracy, faster development, and consistent team-wide behavior.



## Core Concepts
**What is Alchemyst MCP Server?**  
A context-engineering platform that supplies project-specific memory and documentation to developer tooling so AI assistants produce suggestions that follow your project’s requirements and standards.

**Why it matters**  
MCP bridges the gap between generic AI suggestions and project-specific expectations, reducing rework and helping teams move faster with fewer errors.



## Technical Implementation

### Setup Process:
1. **Install MCP**:deploy locally for development or containerize (Docker) for team/production use.  
2. **Integrate with VS Code**: install/configure the MCP extension or point your extension settings to the MCP endpoint.  
3. **Upload PRDs**: add structured project documents (Markdown, PDF, plain text) through the web UI or API and attach metadata (project_id, version, tags).  
4. **Link repositories**: associate PRDs with repositories/workspaces so MCP surfaces the right docs for each codebase.  
5. **Activate Agent Mode**: toggle Agent Mode in the extension to pass context into Copilot; set the agent scope (`file`/`module`/`project`) to control influence.

### Configuration Essentials:
- Set MCP server URL and `API key` in workspace or extension settings.  
- Provide PRD metadata (project_id, title, version, tags, author, last_updated).  
- Use HTTPS/TLS and RBAC in production.



## Quick Start
1. Deploy MCP (local Docker or hosted).  
2. In VS Code, install/configure the Alchemyst MCP extension (set `mcp.server.url` and `mcp.apiKey`).  
3. Upload PRDs and tag them by area (e.g., `auth`, `payments`, `frontend`).  
4. Link the PRDs to your repository/workspace in the MCP dashboard.  
5. Enable **Agent Mode** with a conservative scope (start with `file` or `module`) and test Copilot suggestions.



## Business & Team Impact
- **Increased velocity:** Developers get more relevant suggestions aligned with requirements.  
- **Reduced errors:** Fewer mismatches between intended and generated code.  
- **Consistency:** Team members and CI/CD checks use the same source of truth.  
- **Reliability:** AI assistance becomes dependable for production workflows.



## Practical Applications
- Use PRDs to guide code generation for features (APIs, UX flows, security rules).  
- Maintain context across sessions so the AI remembers project constraints.  
- Integrate MCP into code review and CI pipelines to surface context-aware guidance.



## Best Practices
- Keep PRDs **concise** and **modular**; split large docs into focused pieces.  
- Tag aggressively so MCP can quickly select relevant documents.  
- Start Agent Mode with a narrow scope before scaling it to project-wide.  
- Version your PRDs and map versions to branches or releases.  
- Protect sensitive documents with RBAC and audit logging.


## Troubleshooting
- **Server unreachable:** Check container/process status, open ports, and firewall rules.  
- **Auth failures:** Verify API keys and tokens; check server logs for validation errors.  
- **Copilot not influenced:** Confirm Agent Mode is enabled and the repo is linked to the correct PRD.  
- **Slow responses:** Reduce PRD size or scope; check server resource usage.
