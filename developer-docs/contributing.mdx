</Info>

## How to Contribute

Follow these steps to make your first contribution:

<Steps>
<Step title="Fork and Clone">

</Step>

<Step title="Create a Branch">
Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
Name your branch something descriptive, like `feature/update-api-docs` or `fix/broken-links`.
</Step>

<Step title="Make Changes">
Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and start the development server:
```bash

## Code Style & Standards

When contributing to our documentation, please follow these guidelines:

- Use **clear**, **concise** language
- Follow our **MDX formatting** standards
- Include **examples** where appropriate
- Test all **code snippets**
- Ensure all **links are working**

### Commit Messages
Please follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
- `fix: ...` → for bug fixes  
- `docs: ...` → for documentation changes  
- `feat: ...` → for new features  
- `chore: ...` → for maintenance tasks  


## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses `port 3000`. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on `port 3333`, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm update -g mint

```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of Node.js. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">

    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
