</Step>
</Steps>

### MDX Quick Tips
- Check how MDX works. You can see examples in `/essentials`

### Structure & Navigation

- Place new pages in the most relevant directory (e.g., `ai-context/`, `integrations/`).
- For API docs, follow `api-reference/endpoint/api/v1/...` folder conventions.
- Update `docs.json` to surface new sections/pages in the sidebar navigation.


### Quality Checks
- **Run**: `mint dev` and verify the page renders, links work, and images load
- **Lint/content sanity**: check for broken links, heading hierarchy, and typos
- **Keep line length readable**; wrap long lines and avoid trailing spaces

### Commit and PR
- Commit style: `docs(scope): short summary` (e.g., `docs(ai-context): add diagram`)
- When adding files, update the Directory map in this README (`developer-docs/README.md`).
- Push your branch and open a PR to `main`
- In the PR description: **include screenshots** of visual changes and a brief summary
- Request review from a maintainer; address feedback promptly

Please follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
- `fix: ...` → for bug fixes  
- `docs: ...` → for documentation changes  
- `feat: ...` → for new features  
- `chore: ...` → for maintenance tasks  


## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses `port 3000`. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on `port 3333`, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm update -g mint
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of Node.js. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">

    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
